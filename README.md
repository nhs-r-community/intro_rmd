## Introduction to RMarkdown

This is a repository for the **Introduction to RMarkdown** workshop that was delivered in November of 2021 by Hansel Palencia at the NHS-R Conference.


## Description

Although there is currently introduction training for R, there is a gap in the pathway from analyst to endpoint. The current introduction to R framework finishes with a brief overview of Rmarkdown. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a complete Rmarkdown workshop that would teach R users how to organise their code/visualisations into a fully functional reporting suite.

This workshop teaches the following principles:

* Introduction to Rmarkdown, how to create and edit documents and code chunks, as well as, an introduction to purpose (reproducible analysis)
* Practice exmples of how to create and run report with new data.
* Manipulation options relative to code chunks, YAML, inline code, etc.
* Describing different outputs - PDF, HTML, Word, Powerpoint
* Looping through vectors to generate multiple RMarkdown reports
* Parameterising RMarkdown to develop specific reports
* Demo of advanced functionality available in HTML {plotly}, {crosstalk}, {DT}, {leaflet}


A successful completion of this workshop should give a NHS analyst confidence in the ability to at least create, generate, and then populate an Rmd file into an HTML file with the purpose of reporting.

In the future a further developed advanced workshop could be useful to advance education in this area.

A recording of the workshop is available from the [NHS-R Community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaM6fgwMZIs).
