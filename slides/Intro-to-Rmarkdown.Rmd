# What is rmarkdown?

<br>

.pull-left[
- Rmarkdown (and other packages) facilitate the development and production of highly versatile reports.
- In simplest its simplest use rmarkdown can be seen as a type of code notebook where an analyst can create reproducible and accurate historical records.
]

.pull-right[

```{r, label="logo", echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/rmarkdown_hex.png')

# Why Is This Useful?

<br><br><br>

- The beauty of rmarkdown comes from the ability for an analyst to organise their code into an easy to read and reproducible report.
- In our data world creating reproducible analyses is essential for continuity and accuracy.

# Creating a Report

- Creating an rmarkdown (.rmd) file is easy!
  - Click the Paper with the green plus in the top left corner
  - Generate the type of file you want and click OK
  - DONE!

# How does it work?

- rmarkdown uses markdown language to generate its reports. It also supports a variety of other languages for data generation, manipulation, and visualisation.
- rmarkdown essentially works in three main parts which we’ll look at shortly:
  - YAML – Creates and formats the specific type of report.
  - Markdown Area – Where text formatting and report outlines will go as well as some additional formatting.
  - Code area – “Chunks” where code goes that will run when the report is run.

# YAML – Yet Another Markdown Language

.pull-left[

- The YAML is used to format the report as well as specify what type of output will be created.
  - Options include HTML, PDF, Word, Powerpoint, and more...

]

.pull-right[

```{r, label="parms", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/params_file1.png')
```

# Markdown Area

- The Markdown Area is used to format within the report itself.
  - Examples include: Headers, Tabs, Bolds, Italics, Lists, Numbered Lists, and more...

# Code Area

- The Coding Area is used as a space to develop code for the rmarkdown report.
- The majority of times the final output of these code chunks will be some type of visualization (graph, table, etc.)

# SHOWCASE

## Let’s See Your Efforts!

# Parameterized rmarkdown

- Parameterized reports allow you to create multiple reports with different inputs (like working with functions)
  - The input parameter will take the location of every named parameter space

# Functions for rmarkdown Automation

- Since rmarkdown itself is a package there are some functions that can be used to generate reports on the fly.

---

# Demo

- There are a multitude of packages that can work in conjunction with rmarkdown, therefore allowing an analyst to create dynamic or interactive reports, giving a more dashboard feel.
